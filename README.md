# CodeLeap Test

A simple social network application where users can sign up, create posts, edit and delete them, and browse through a paginated feed.

This project was built as part of a technical challenge, showcasing a **React frontend** consuming a **Django REST Framework backend**.

‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- Python 3.11+
- pip

## Backend Setup (Django API)

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arturbordignon/codeleap.git
cd codeleap/api
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # on Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

5. Start the backend server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

By default, the API will be available at:
üëâ http://localhost:8000/careers/

All the .env Configs have conditions (this is not a good practice, but for this example I made it), so you won't get any problem running locally, but if you want to deploy, add this:
```bash
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DEBUG=(False for Production, True for Local)

# Example for PostgreSQL (Render provides DATABASE_URL automatically):
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname
FRONTEND_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3500 (Or Production URL of the Frontend)
```


## Frontend Setup (React app)

1. Move into the client folder:

```bash
cd ../client (if you are at /api)
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a .env file in the client/ folder:

```bash
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000/careers/
```

4. Start the frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

By default, the app runs at:
üëâ http://localhost:3500/

The Production URL's are:

Backend:

```bash
https://codeleap-v15c.onrender.com/careers/
```

Frontend:

```bash
https://codeleap-backend-xkpe.onrender.com
```
